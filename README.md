# COVID-19 X-ray Dataset (Train & Test Sets)

## Overview

This repository contains a curated dataset of chest X-ray images to aid in the detection of COVID-19 and other respiratory conditions. The dataset is divided into training and testing sets, each categorized into three main classes: **COVID-19 Positive**, **Normal**, and **Pneumonia**. This dataset is designed for machine learning and deep learning applications, particularly for image classification tasks using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs).

## Dataset Structure

The dataset is structured into two primary directories:
- **Train Set**: Contains labeled images for training machine learning models.
- **Test Set**: Contains labeled images for model evaluation and testing.

Each set contains subdirectories representing different classes:
- `COVID-19/`
- `Normal/`
- `Pneumonia/`
